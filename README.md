# Housing-Price-Prediction

Housing Price Prediction project predicts the price of the house on the basis of location, ocean proximity, income, Number of rooms, bedrooms per household and etc. 
Here income is most important feature to predict the housing price. Added some features by combining existing features.

I have used random forest regressor algorithm to predict the result. Fine tune the model hyper-parametes using GridSearchCV library. Achieved 95% Accuracy in prediction.
